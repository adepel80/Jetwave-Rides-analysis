# Jetwave-Rides-analysis
This project presents a comprehensive rides Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The goal of this project is to visualize and analyze jetwave trip data to uncover key insights related to ride demand patterns, revenue performance, and customer behavior.
By integrating multiple datasets and leveraging Power BI’s data modeling and visualization capabilities, this project provides a data-driven foundation for understanding how Uber rides vary across time, location, and user segments.

# 🎯 Objectives

Analyze trip volume trends across different days, hours, and months.

Identify peak demand periods to help optimize driver availability.

Track revenue, distance, and ride frequency by city and category.

Compare performance across vehicle types (e.g., UberX, UberPool, Uber Black).

Provide interactive visualizations for stakeholders to explore patterns in real time.


# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard design.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For key metrics and measures.

Power Query Editor – Data transformation and cleaning.

Excel / CSV / SQL – As data sources for trip and revenue data.

Map Visualization Tools – For geographical route and city-level insights.
